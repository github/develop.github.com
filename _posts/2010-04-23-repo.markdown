## Repositories API ##

### Searching Repositories ###

  repos/search/:q

To search for repositories that have to do with testing ruby, you could do this:

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/search/ruby+testing
    {
      "repositories": [
        {
          "type": "repo",
          "language": "Ruby",
          "has_downloads": true,
          "url": "https://github.com/geemus/fog",
          "homepage": "",
          "pushed_at": "2011/01/05 11:24:06 -0800",
          "created_at": "2009/05/18 00:14:04 -0700",
          "fork": false,
          "has_wiki": true,
          "score": 0.45233846,
          "size": 5732,
          "private": false,
          "name": "fog",
          "watchers": 807,
          "owner": "geemus",
          "open_issues": 13,
          "description": "The Ruby cloud computing library.",
          "forks": 95,
          "has_issues": true,
          "followers": 807,                       // deprecated
          "pushed": "2011/01/05 11:24:06 -0800",  // deprecated
          "created": "2009/05/18 00:14:04 -0700", // deprecated
          "username": "geemus"                    // deprecated
        }
      ]
    }

Note: The API has been updated to return the values with the same key names as the regular Repository API.  As a result, some keys may have similarly named keys to keep compatibility with older scripts.  If you're writing a new app, favor the new keys over the old ones:

* <del>`followers`</del> `=>` `watchers`
* <del>`username`</del> `=>` `owner`
* <del>`pushed`</del> `=>` `pushed_at`
* <del>`created`</del> `=>` `created_at`

You can pass a custom page number and/or a language to narrow the search:

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/search/ruby+testing?start_page=2
    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/search/ruby+testing?language=Ruby

Language searching is done with the capitalized format of the name: "Ruby", not "ruby".
It takes the same values as the language drop down on [http://github.com/search](http://github.com/search).

### Show Repo Info ###

To look at more in-depth information for a repository, GET this

  repos/show/:user/:repo

For example, to see the information for Grit

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/schacon/grit
    {
      "repository": {
        "url": "https://github.com/schacon/grit",
        "has_issues": true,
        "homepage": "http://grit.rubyforge.org/",
        "watchers": 106,
        "source": "mojombo/grit",
        "parent": "mojombo/grit",
        "has_downloads": true,
        "created_at": "2008/04/18 16:14:24 -0700",
        "forks": 11,
        "fork": true,
        "has_wiki": true,
        "private": false,
        "pushed_at": "2010/05/05 15:28:38 -0700",
        "name": "grit",
        "description": "Grit is a Ruby library for extracting information from a git repository in an object oriented manner - this fork tries to intergrate as much pure-ruby functionality as possible",
        "owner": "schacon",
        "open_issues": 0
      }
    }

Some keys, such as `source` and `parent` are only available on the show repo
action.  They won't show up on repo lists or searches.

### Set Repo Info ###

If you are authenticated, you can update your repo's information by
POSTing to it.

    /repos/show/:user/:repo [POST]

      :values[key] = value

Where the POST values are of:

    description
    homepage
    has_wiki
    has_issues
    has_downloads

So, you could do this to update your repo's homepage:

    $ curl -F 'login=schacon' -F 'token=XXX' https://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/schacon/grit -F 'values[homepage]=http://schacon.github.com/grit'


### List All Repositories ###

You can list out all the repositories for a user with

  repos/show/:user

For example, to see all of schacons public repos, we can GET

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/schacon
    {
      "repositories": [
        {
          "url": "https://github.com/schacon/ruby-git",
          "homepage": "",
          "watchers": 290,
          "open_issues": 14,
          "created_at": "2008/01/27 09:23:23 -0800",
          "pushed_at": "2009/10/17 08:00:28 -0700",
          "has_issues": true,
          "fork": false,
          "has_downloads": true,
          "private": false,
          "name": "ruby-git",
          "description": "Ruby/Git is a Ruby library that can be used to create, read and manipulate Git repositories by wrapping system calls to the git binary.",
          "forks": 64,
          "owner": "schacon",
          "has_wiki": true
        }
      ]
    }

If you are authenticated as that user, you can see all the private repositories as well.  This API call will return 30 results per page.  You can specify pages with the `?page` parameter:

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/schacon?page=2

### Watching Repositories ###

You have to be authenticated for this, but you can watch and unwatch repositories with calls to

  repos/unwatch/:user/:repo
  repos/watch/:user/:repo

### Forking Repositories ###

You can also fork a repository with

  repos/fork/:user/:repo

Which will return data about your newly forked repository.

  curl -F 'login=schacon' -F 'token=XXX' http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/fork/dim/retrospectiva

### Creating and Deleting Repositories ###

To create a new repository, hit this url

  repos/create

with at least 'name' but it will take any of these as POST args

  name        => name of the repository.  ex: "my-repo" or "other-user/my-repo"
  description => repo description
  homepage    => homepage url
  public      => 1 for public, 0 for private

You can also delete a repository with a POST to

  repos/delete/:user/:repo
  repos/delete/:repo (DEPRECATED)

which will give you back a token in the 'delete\_token' field of the response, which you then have to post back to the same url again (in the 'delete\_token' POST var) to complete the deletion.

### Repository Visibility ###

To set a public repository private, you can POST while authenticated to

  repos/set/private/:user/:repo
  repos/set/private/:repo (DEPRECATED)

To make a private repo public, POST while authenticated to

  repos/set/public/:user/:repo
  repos/set/public/:repo (DEPRECATED)

### Deploy Keys ###

You can use the API to list, add and remove your deploy keys.  To see which deploy keys you have setup for a specific repository, GET this URL

  repos/keys/:user/:repo
  repos/keys/:repo (DEPRECATED)

It will give you a listing of your public keys, like so

    $ curl -F 'login=schacon' -F 'token=XXX' http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/keys/bob/retrospectiva
    {
      "public_keys": [
        {
          "title": "my deploy key",
          "id": 553719,
          "key": "ssh-rsa ....."
        }
      ]
    }

You can also add new keys by POSTing to

  repos/key/:user/:repo/add
  repos/key/:repo/add (DEPRECATED)

which takes the following POST variables

  title   => title of the key
  key  => public key data

You can also POST to this removal URL to remove a key

  repos/key/:user/:repo/remove
  repos/key/:repo/remove (DEPRECATED)

You will need to POST an 'id' variable with the key ID returned from the public listing or key creation.

### Collaborators ###

To get a list of the collaborators on your project:

  repos/show/:user/:repo/collaborators [GET]

Organization repositories will return the unique users across the repository's
teams.

To add or remove collaborators, POST to one of these URLs

  repos/collaborators/:user/:repo/add/:collaborator
  repos/collaborators/:user/:repo/remove/:collaborator
  repos/collaborators/:repo/add/:collaborator (DEPRECATED)
  repos/collaborators/:repo/remove/:collaborator (DEPRECATED)

To get a list of repos you can push to that are not your own:

  repos/pushable [GET]

To get a list of the Teams for this repository (if it is in an Organization):

  repos/show/:user/:repo/teams [GET]

### Contributors ###

To get a list of the contributors on your project, GET

    repos/show/:user/:repo/contributors

The data comes back as an array of [login, count], sorted by the biggest contributors to the repository.

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/mxcl/homebrew/contributors
    {
      "contributors": [
        {
          "name": "Adam Vandenberg",
          "gravatar_id": "7ea0cc75793eb2b1ada4abc953a41592",
          "contributions": 1367,
          "location": "Issaquah, WA",
          "blog": "http://adamv.com/",
          "type": "User",
          "login": "adamv",
          "email": "flangy@gmail.com"
        }
      ]
    }

By default, the list only shows GitHub users.  You can include non-users too:

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/mxcl/homebrew/contributors/anon
    {
      "contributors": [
        {
          "name": "Adam Vandenberg",
          "gravatar_id": "7ea0cc75793eb2b1ada4abc953a41592",
          "contributions": 1367,
          "location": "Issaquah, WA",
          "blog": "http://adamv.com/",
          "type": "User",
          "login": "adamv",
          "email": "flangy@gmail.com"
        },
        {
          "name": "minusfive",
          "contributions": 1
        }
      ]
    }

### Watchers ###

To get a list of the watchers on your project, GET

    repos/show/:user/:repo/watchers

The data comes back as an array of watchers, sorted by the date they started watching the repository.

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/claudiob/csswaxer/watchers
    {
      "watchers": [
        "claudiob",
        "handrus"
      ]
    }

You can receive the full public user profile by adding `?full=1` to requests:

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/claudiob/csswaxer/watchers?full=1
    {
      "watchers": [
        {
          "name": "Claudio B.",
          "company": "",
          "gravatar_id": "4dea5cf83d2d6c1228750b76e579b38d",

          "login": "claudiob",
          "email": ""
        }
      ]
    }

### Network ###

We can also look at the full network with

  repos/show/:user/:repo/network

For example, to see all the forks of the ruby-git project, we can GET

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/schacon/ruby-git/network
    {
      "network": [
        {
          "url": "https://github.com/schacon/ruby-git",
          "has_wiki": true,
          "homepage": "",
          "pushed_at": "2009/10/17 08:00:28 -0700",
          "watchers": 290,
          "created_at": "2008/01/27 09:23:23 -0800",
          "forks": 64,
          "open_issues": 14,
          "fork": false,
          "has_issues": true,
          "private": false,
          "has_downloads": true,
          "name": "ruby-git",
          "description": "Ruby/Git is a Ruby library that can be used to create, read and manipulate Git repositories by wrapping system calls to the git binary.",
          "owner": "schacon"
        }
      ]
    }

### Language Breakdown ###

To see a list of the languages used in a particular repository, you can call
the language breakdown API.  Values are in bytes calculated.

  /repos/show/:user/:repo/languages

You can get the language breakdown for mojombo/grit like this:

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/mojombo/grit/languages
    {"languages":{"Ruby":223245}}

Note that this is based on a very simple algorithm and is not perfect.  Common
large libraries are removed and languages are solely identified by file
extension.

### Repository Refs ###

To get a list of tags on your repo

  repos/show/:user/:repo/tags

For example

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/schacon/ruby-git/tags
    {
      "tags": {
        "v1.2.0": "cfad76700b3d38eb3be97e2d5ef75cc0a398f818",
        "1.0.3": "be47ad8aea4f854fc2d6773456fb28f3e9f519e7",

        "v1.0.7": "1adc5b8136c2cd6c694629947e1dbc49c8bffe6a"
      }
    }

To get a list of remote branches

  repos/show/:user/:repo/branches

For example

    $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/schacon/ruby-git/branches
    {
      "branches": {
        "master": "94f389bf5d9af4511597d035e69d1be9510b50c7",
        "internals": "6a9db968e8563bc27b8f56f9d413159a2e14cf67",
        "integrate": "10b880b418879e662feb91ce7af98560adeaa8bb",
        "test": "2d749e3aa69d7bfedf814f59618f964fdbc300d5"
      }
    }
